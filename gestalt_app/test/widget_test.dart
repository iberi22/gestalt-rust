// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

  testWidgets('App smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const GestaltApp());

    // Verify that the app title or main layout is present.
    // Since MainLayout might be complex, just ensuring it pumps without error is a good start.
    // checking for the title in the MaterialApp (this doesn't render text, but the app should build)
